The mobile application will be used to find restaurants and view information about them while the web portal will be used for managing the information about the restaurants and the system as a whole. The mobile application will need to communicate to a GPS application within the mobile phone, which in turn communicates with a physical GPS device to find the location of the user, see Figure 1. The GPS will provide the mobile application with locations of both the user and the restaurants and the distance between them, but it will also provide maps and the functionality to display the application’s data on the map. The functionality provided by the GPS will be embedded into the application in order for the user to be able to use the functions in the application in a seamlessly manner. Since this is a data-centric product it will need somewhere to store the data. For that, a database will be used. Both the mobile application and web portal will communicate with the database, however in slightly different ways. The mobile application will only use the database to get data while the web portal will also add and modify data. All of the database communication will go over the Internet. The mobile application has some restrictions about the resource allocation. To avoid problems with overloading the operating system the application is only allowed to use 20 megabytes of memory while running the application. The maximum amount of hard drive space is also 20 megabytes.','LARGE','AGILE',1,1,NULL,'2019-01-18 14:23:21','2018-11-29 16:30:36'),(3,'GPM Global Personal Marketplace','The Global Personal Marketplace (GPM) system will be a global Web-based marketplace bringing together private individuals and small companies to buy and sell all manner of items.
